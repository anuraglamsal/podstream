Step 1: Build a user authentication system that works without caring for the layout of the concerned pages.

   * Learn how to make fields and establish validators in wtforms. 
   
   * Learn how to lay those fields out in html. *(how to send them through the main module and use Jinja to lay them out in html)*
   
   * Learn how to validate in the main module and show validation errors on the html page. 
   
   * Learn how to save user information and then retrieve it for login. *(Learn how to use an ORM library like SQLAlchmey to make things        relatively easy when it comes to working with database.)*

Step 2: After the system is fully foolproof, do frontend stuff (i.e. first learn and then do).
